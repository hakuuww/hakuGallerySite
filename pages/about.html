        <br />
        <p>born and raised in Shanghai, China, currrently studying Computer Engineering at the Univeristy of Waterloo,
            Ontario, Canada. </p>
            <br />
        <p>Street photography is one of my passion and I guess what got me started was my curiousity. Before my exposure
            to photography I always enjoyed using my senses like vision and hearing to percept the world and locate
            emotions wether its sadness, energy, beauty or &quot;those&quot; feelings that simply can&#39;t be explained
            in words. The idea of street photography (although with its own limitations) just came natural to me as it
            captures those moments in a candid, observatory way through visual communication. </p>
            <br />
        <p>Currently I try to capture interesting moments in Waterloo, Ontario which is where I go to school. Since I
            alternate between work and study every four months, I also have the opportunity to take photos in other
            parts of Ontario or maybe in the United States eventually if I actually put in the work to learn code and
            become a brilliant eningeer. </p>
            <br />
        <p>A 28mm or a 35mm is currently what I have, have tried and can handle, but something wider than a 28mm also
            attracts me. Wong Kar Wai&#39;s Fallen Angels shot by Christopher Doyle is unlike any other movie, one of
            the reason due to its lense choice, something near a 6mm. The exaggeration and anti-compression of space
            that an extreme fish eye lense provides will definitely be on my mind for experimental ideas and projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The Ricoh GR3 is my daily carry, but I wish to shoot more film in the future since it will force me to be
            more serious and technical.
            Hunting for a Leica M6 currently.</p>
