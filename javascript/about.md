### About Anthony Xu

born and raised in Shanghai, China, currrently studying Computer Engineering at the Univeristy of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. 

Street photography is one of my passion and I guess what got me started was my curiousity. Before my exposure to photography I always enjoyed using my senses like vision and hearing to percept the world and locate emotions wether its sadness, energy, beauty or "those" feelings that simply can't be explained in words. The idea of street photography (although with its own limitations) just came natural to me as it captures those moments in a candid, observatory way through visual communication. 

Currently I try to capture interesting moments in Waterloo, Ontario which is where I go to school. Since I alternate between work and study every four months, I also have the opportunity to take photos in other parts of Ontario or maybe in the United States eventually if I actually put in the work to learn code and become a brilliant eningeer. 

A 28mm or a 35mm is currently what I have, have tried and can handle, but something wider than a 28mm also attracts me. Wong Kar Wai's Fallen Angels shot by Christopher Doyle is unlike any other movie, one of the reason due to its lense choice, something near a 6mm. The exaggeration and anti-compression of space that an extreme fish eye lense provides will definitely be on my mind for experimental ideas and projects.

The Ricoh GR3 is my daily carry, but I wish to shoot more film in the future since it will force me to be more serious and technical.
Hunting for a Leica M6 currently.
